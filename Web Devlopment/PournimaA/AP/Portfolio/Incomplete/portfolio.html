     <p>I avoided you all week long.
         All week.
             It was hard,but I did it.
                 I avoided you because i was used to you
                     Then today came.
                         I heard you laugh for the first time in a week.
                             And I just lost me........

        tula pahile an sanja mand zhali,
             osharalya chandanya hava kund zhali,
                 shuddhit hote atach sare,
          tu pahije an vela dhund zhali........
     </p>
     <p>
                             I just want it to happen
                         Like it's a work of magic.
                     Like some kind of miracle
                 That cancels all that is tragic.
             A spontaneous kind of thing
         Without me saying a word
      As if you read my very thoughts   
        Because I can't stand any more
             Of the things I've had to bear.
                 The many kinds of disrespect
                     And the obvious lack of care.
                         I need that someone special
                             Who has the gift of giving.
                                 Who sees in me perfection
                                     Your world, life, and everything.
     </p>
     <p>
        life ki bindass hu, phir bhi pata nhi kyu pareshaan si hu me,
                     sab kuch hai pass, phir bhi pata nhi kya dhundhati rahati hu aaspaas me,
                 sab bolate hai me sath hu tere, phir bhi logo ki bhid me akeli hu me,
                         koi mujhase pyaar kare ya na kare, phir bhi sabko apana maanati hu me,
             sab jaanati hu, phir bhi bahot kuch anjaan hu me.
     </p>
     <p>Just like the stars at night,
             Just like the vast ocean,
                     Just like the strands of your hair,
         Just like the rain that drips,
                     Just like the sand that flows with the wind,
                 Just like the numbers that we count,
             Just like the clouds at daytime,
                         Just like the rays of the sun,
                     Just like the people around us,
                 How can you stop,
        My love that's never-ending?
         Oh, I know now,
     It's because you don't feel
             the same way as I do.
